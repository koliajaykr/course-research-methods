## :earth_asia: Science

"A set of logical, systematic, documented methods for investigating **nature and natural processes**; the knowledge produced by these investigations."[^1]

[^1]: @chamblissMakingSenseSocial2018

## :handshake: Social Science

"The use of scientific methods to investigate **individuals, societies, and social processes**; the knowledge produced by these investigations."[^2]

[^2]: @chamblissMakingSenseSocial2018

## Inquiry[^3]

[^3]: @babbiePracticeSocialResearch2020

-   **Agreement Reality:** Those things we "know" as part and parcel of the culture we share with those around us.

-   **Epistemology:** The science of knowing systems of knowledge.

-   **Methodology:** The science of finding out; procedures for scientific investigation.

## :thinking: Why Research?

"Research results in the **creation of knowledge** to solve a problem, answer a question, and better describe or understand something." [^4]

[^4]: @cloughStudentGuideMethodology2012

## Define Research

"the **process** of finding solutions to a problem after a thorough study and analysis of the situational factors"[^5]

[^5]: @sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

## Four Goals of Social Research Are:[^9]

[^9]: @chamblissMakingSenseSocial2018

::: nonincremental
1.  To Describe

2.  To Explore

3.  To Explain

4.  To Evaluate
:::

## Descriptive Research

Research in which social phenomena are defined and described.

![](image/describe.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Exploratory Research

Seeks to find out how people get along in the setting under question, what **meanings** they give to their actions, and what issues concern them.

![](image/explore.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Explanatory (Causal) Research

Seeks to identify causes and effects of social phenomena and to **predict** how one phenomenon will change or vary in response to variation in another phenomenon.

![](image/causal.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Evaluation Research

Research that describes or identifies the **impact** of social policies and programs.

1.  Qualitative
2.  Quantitative, and
3.  Mixed methods
:::

## Qualitative Approach

::: {columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

# [Research<br>Proposal]{style="color:#ffffff"} {background-image="image/proposal.jpg" background-size="contain" background-position="right" background-color="black"}

## Research Proposal[^12]

[^12]: @babbiePracticeSocialResearch2020

-   Most organized research begins with a description of **what is planned** in the project: what questions it will raise and how it will answer them.

-   Often such proposals are created for the purpose of **getting the resources** needed to conduct the research envisioned.

## Research Proposal[^13]

[^13]: @sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

-   Before any research study is undertaken, there should be an **agreement** between the person who authorizes the study and the researcher as to:

    -   the problem to be investigated,

    -   the methodology to be used,

    -   the duration of the study, and

    -   its cost.

## Arguments Presented in a Proposal

1.  What do readers need to better understand your topic?

2.  What do readers need to know about your topic?

3.  What do you propose to study?

4.  What is the setting, and who are the people you will study?

5.  What methods do you plan to use to collect data?

6.  How will you analyze the data?

7.  How will you validate your findings?

8.  What ethical issues will your study present?

9.  What do preliminary results show about the practicability and value of the proposed study?

## Format for a Quantitative Proposal

-   Introduction

-   Statement of the problem (issue, existing literature about problem, deficiencies in literature, relevance of study for audiences)

-   Purpose of the study

-   Research questions or hypotheses

-   Theoretical perspective

-   Review of the literature (theory may be included in this section instead of the introduction)

-   Methods

-   Type of research design (e.g., experimental, survey)

-   Population, sample, and participants

-   Data collection instruments, variables, and materials

-   Data analysis procedures

-   Anticipated ethical issues in the study

-   Preliminary studies or pilot tests

-   Appendixes: Instruments, timeline, and proposed budget

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Designing the Sections of a Proposal[^14]

-   Specify the sections early in the design of a proposal. ... develop an outline.

-   Study previous proposal for the same organisation or supervisor.

-   Attend program or course on proposal development

-   Sit down with your adviser or supervisor, and go over his or her preferred format for a proposal.

# [writing]{style="color:#ffffff"} {.big-text background-image="image/writingdream.jpg" background-size="cover"}

## Writing Ideas[^15]

[^15]: @creswellResearchDesignQualitative2018

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<br> <br> "to practice writing rather than simply talk about it"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](image/writingpaper2.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Writing as Thinking

-   Early in the process of research, **write ideas** down rather than talk about them.

-   Working through **several drafts** of a proposal rather than trying to polish the first draft

-   Do not edit your proposal at the early-draft stage.

    -   First develop an outline; it could be a sentence or word outline or a visual map
    -   Write out a draft and then shift and sort ideas, moving entire paragraphs in the manuscript.
    -   Finally, edit and polish each sentence.

## The Habit of Writing

-   Establish the discipline of writing in a regular and continuous way on your proposal.

-   Make writing a daily activity, regardless of mood, regardless of readiness to write.

-   Write while you are fresh.

-   Avoid writing in binges (excessive).

-   Write in small, regular amounts

-   Schedule writing tasks

-   Time spent writing + page finished + tasks completed

-   Share your writing with supportive peers.

## Reabability of the Manuscript

-   Use consistent terms in your proposal.

-   Readers need road signs to guide them from one major idea to the next.

-   Coherence in writing means that the ideas tie together and logically flow from one sentence to another and from one paragraph to another.

## Voice, Tense, and "Fat"

-   Use the active voice as much as possible in scholarly writing.

-   Use strong active verbs.

-   Pay close attention to the tense of past studies:

    -   Past simple tense or the present perfect tense for the literature review and procedures based on past events,
    -   The past simple tense to describe results,
    -   The present tense to discuss the results and to present the conclusions.

-   Edit and revise drafts to trim the fat.

# [ethics]{style="color:#ffffff"} {.big-text background-image="image/ethics.jpg" background-size="cover"}

## Ethics & Research[^16]

[^16]: @sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

-   "code of conduct or expected societal norms of behaviour while conducting research."
-   Ethical conduct applies to:
    -   the organization,

    -   the members that sponsor the research,

    -   the researchers who undertake the research, and

    -   the respondents who provide them with the necessary data.

    -   **Precision:** refers to the closeness of the findings to "reality" based on a sample.
    -   **Confidence:** refers to the probability that our estimations are correct.

## Hallmarks of Scientific Research - [Objectivity:]{style="color:#00589b"}

-   Conclusions should be based upon the facts of the findings derived from actual data,and not on our own subjective or emotional values.

-   The more objective the interpretation of the data, the more scientific the research investigation becomes.

## Hallmarks of Scientific Research - [Generalizability:]{style="color:#00589b"}

-   Refers to the scope (wider range) of applicability of the research findings in one organizational setting to other settings.

-   Not many research findings can be generalized to all other settings.

-   A more elaborate sampling design, which would doubtless increase the generalizability of the results.

## Hallmarks of Scientific Research - [Parsimony:]{style="color:#00589b"}

-   Simplicity in explaining the phenomena or problems that occur.

-   A good understanding of the problem and the important factors that influence it.

## Why Literature Review?

-   "literature review helps to determine whether the topic is **worth studying**, and it provides insight into ways in which the researcher can **limit the scope** to a needed area of inquiry."

-   "to consider whether the research topic can and should be researched"

## Purpose of Literature Review:

-   It shares with the reader the **results of other studies** that are closely related to the one being undertaken.

-   It relates a study to the larger, **ongoing dialogue** in the literature, filling in gaps and extending prior studies

-   It provides a framework for establishing the importance of the study as well as a benchmark for **comparing the results** with other findings.

## LR Sources

-   Textbooks

-   Journals

-   Theses

-   Conference proceedings

-   Unpublished manuscripts

-   Reports

-   Newspapers

-   The Internet

## Literature Review Process[^26]...

[^26]: @creswellResearchDesignQualitative2018

1.  Begin by identifying key words

2.  Searching the databases like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), Web of Science, EBSCO, ProQuest, and JSTOR or you can also use website like [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/) to download books and papers.

3.  Locate about 50 reports of research in articles or books related to research on your topic.

4.  Skim this initial group of articles or chapters, and collect those that are central to your topic.

## Literature Review Process...

5.  Designing a **literature map** ... a **visual picture of groupings** of the literature on the topic that illustrates how your particular study will add to the existing literature and position your study within the larger body of research.

6.  Begin to draft summaries of the most relevant articles. Include precise references to the literature using an appropriate style guide like APA.

## Literature Review Process

7.  After summarizing the literature, assemble the literature review, structuring it thematically or organizing it by important concepts. This summary should also point toward the methods ... It is at this point as well that you could advance a critique of the past literature and point our deficiencies in it and issues in its methods.

## The Use of Theory[^29]

[^29]: @creswellResearchDesignQualitative2018

### In quantitative research,

-   Researchers often test hypotheses stemming from theories.

-   Broader theory guiding the study hypotheses.

## The Use of Theory

### In qualitative research

-   It may generate a theory as the final outcome of a study and place it at the end of a project

-   Sometimes it comes at the beginning and provides a lens that shapes what is looked at and the questions asked

## The Use of Theory

### In mixed methods research

-   Researchers may both test theories and generate them

-   Contain a theoretical framework within which both quantitative and qualitative data are collected

## Quantitative Theory Use

-   Causality: means we would expect variable X to cause variable Y.

-   Does drinking one glass of red wine daily *cause* you have a reduced risk for a heart attack?

    $$Red\;Wine \longrightarrow Heart\;attack$$

    $$X \longrightarrow Y$$

## Variables in Quantitative Research

-   **Variable:** "refers to a characteristic or attribute of an individual or an organization that can be measured or observed and that varies among the people or organization being studied."

-   Gender, age, socio-economic status; attitudes or behaviours such as racism, social control, political power, leadership etc..

## Variables in Quantitative Research

-   **Independent variables:**

    -   Those that influence, or affect outcomes in experimental studies.

    -   They are manipulated in an experiment and thus independent of all other influences.

## Variables in Quantitative Research

-   **Dependent variables:**

    -   Those that depend on the independent variables,

    -   They are the outcomes or results of the influence of the independent variables

## Variables in Quantitative Research

-   Independent variable/Predictor variable

-   Dependent variable / Outcome variable

-   Confounding variable

-   Mediating variable

-   Moderating variable

## Theory in Quantitative Research

-   "A set of interrelated constructs (variables), definitions, and prepositions that presents a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relations among variables, with the purpose of explaining natural phenomena" (adapted from Kerlinger 1979)

## Theory in Quantitative Research

-   "Theory helps to explain (predict) phenomena that occur in the world"

-   "Theories develop when researchers test a prediction over and over."

![](image/rainbow.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Developing a Theory

1.  Investigators combine independent, mediating, and dependent variables into questions.

2.  These questions provide information about the type of relationship (positive, negative, or unknown) and its magnitude (high or low).

3.  Forming this information into a predictive statement (hypothesis)

4.  When researcher test hypotheses over and over in different settings and with different populations, a theory emerges, and someone gives it a name.

5.  Theory develops as an explanation to advance knowledge in particular fields.

## Levels of Theory

-   **Micro-level Theories:** provide explanations limited to small slices of time, space, or number of people; such as Goffman's theory of face work.

-   **Meso-level Theories:** link micro and macro levels; like theories of organizations, social movement, or communities; such as Collin's theory of control in organizations.

-   **Maco-level Theories:** explain larger aggregates, such as social institutions, cultural systems, and whole societies; such as theory of social stratification.

## Placing Theory in a Quant Study

```{r}
theory_tbl <- data.frame(
  Placement = c("In the introduction",
                "In the literature review",
                "After hypotheses or research questions as a rationale.",
                "In a separate section"),
  Advantage = c("As an approach often found in journal articles, it will be familiar to readers. It conveys a deductive approach.",
                "Theories are found in the literature, and their inclusion in a literature review is a logical extension or part of the literature.",
                "The theory discussion is a logical extension of hypotheses or research questions because it explains how and why variables are related.",
                "This approach clearly separates the theory from other components of the research process, and it enables a reader to better identify and to understand the theory base for the study."),
  Disadvantage = c("It is difficult for a reader to isloate and speparate theory base from other components of the research process (e.g., with the methods).",
                   "It is difficult for a reader to see the theory in isolation form topics being reviewed in the literature.",
                   "A write may include a theoretical rationale after hypotheses and questions and leave out an extended discussion about the origin and rationale for the use of the theory.",
                   "The theory discussion standss in isolation from other components of the research proceess (e.g., the questions of the methods) and, as such, a reader may not easily connect it with other components of the research process.")

## Writing Quant Theoretical Perspective

::: callout-tip
"The theory that I will use is .............. (name the theory). It was developed by ................. (identify the origin, source, or developer of the theory), and it was used to study .............. (identify the topics where one finds the theory being applied). This theory indicates that ................. (identify the propositions or hypotheses in the theory). As applied to my study, this theory hold that I would expect my independent variable(s) .............. (state independent variables) to influence or explain the dependent variable(s) ................ (state dependent variables) because .............. (provide a rationale based on the logic of the theory)."
:::

## Qualitative Theory Use

## Qual Theoretical Perspectives

-   **Feminist perspectives**: realizing social justice for women.

-   **Racialized discourses:** about people and communities of colour.

-   **Critical theory:** empowering human beings to overcome race, class, gender, and caste.

-   **Queer theory:** focuses on LGBT people.

-   **Disability inquiry:** understanding this population's sociocultural perspectives.

## Inductive Logic in Qual Study

$$Researcher\;poses\;generalizations\;or\;theories\\from\;past\;experience\;and\;literature\\ \uparrow \\ Researcher\;looks\;for\;broad\;patterns,\\\; generalizations,\;or\;theories\;from\;themes\;or\;categories$$

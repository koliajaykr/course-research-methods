## :earth_asia: Science

"A set of logical, systematic, documented methods for investigating **nature and natural processes**; the knowledge produced by these investigations."[^1]

[^1]: @chamblissMakingSenseSocial2018

## :handshake: Social Science

"The use of scientific methods to investigate **individuals, societies, and social processes**; the knowledge produced by these investigations."[^2]

[^2]: @chamblissMakingSenseSocial2018

## Inquiry[^3]

[^3]: @babbiePracticeSocialResearch2020

-   **Agreement Reality:** Those things we "know" as part and parcel of the culture we share with those around us.

-   **Epistemology:** The science of knowing systems of knowledge.

-   **Methodology:** The science of finding out; procedures for scientific investigation.

## :thinking: Why Research?

"Research results in the **creation of knowledge** to solve a problem, answer a question, and better describe or understand something." [^4]

[^4]: @cloughStudentGuideMethodology2012

## Define Research

"the **process** of finding solutions to a problem after a thorough study and analysis of the situational factors"[^5]

[^5]: @sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

## Define Research

"is about asking questions, exploring problems and **reflecting on** what emerges in order to make meaning from the data and tell the **research story**"[^6]

[^6]: @cloughStudentGuideMethodology2012

## Types of Business Research[^7]

[^7]: @sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

## Research Methods Help to Avoid[^8]:

[^8]: @chamblissMakingSenseSocial2018

::: nonincremental
-   Over-generalization

-   Selective or inaccurate observation

-   Illogical reasoning

-   Resistance to change\
:::

::: callout-important
-   **Generalization** will be coming back again and again in future sessions kindly make a note of it.
:::

## Research Methods Help to Avoid:

**Over-generalization:** "Occurs when we unjustifiably conclude that what is true for some cases is true for all cases"

![](image/observation1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Research Methods Help to Avoid:

**Selective or inaccurate observation:** "Choosing to look only at things that are in line with our preferences or beliefs."

![](image/observation2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Research Methods Help to Avoid:

**Illogical reasoning:** "The premature jumping to conclusions or arguing on the basis of invalid assumptions."

![](image/observation.png){fig-align="center"}

## Research Methods Help to Avoid:

**Resistance to change:** "The reluctance to change our ideas in light of new information."

## Four Goals of Social Research Are:[^9]

[^9]: @chamblissMakingSenseSocial2018

::: nonincremental
1.  To Describe

2.  To Explore

3.  To Explain

4.  To Evaluate
:::

## Descriptive Research

Research in which social phenomena are defined and described.

![](image/describe.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Exploratory Research

Seeks to find out how people get along in the setting under question, what **meanings** they give to their actions, and what issues concern them.

![](image/explore.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Explanatory (Causal) Research

Seeks to identify causes and effects of social phenomena and to **predict** how one phenomenon will change or vary in response to variation in another phenomenon.

![](image/causal.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Evaluation Research

Research that describes or identifies the **impact** of social policies and programs.

## Research Approach[^10]

[^10]: @creswellResearchDesignQualitative2018

-   "Research approaches are **plans and the procedures** for research that span the steps from broad assumptions to detailed methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation."

-   "It involves the **intersection** of philosophical assumptions, designs and specific methods."

## Three Research Approaches are:

::: nonincremental
1.  Qualitative
2.  Quantitative, and
3.  Mixed methods
:::

## Qualitative Approach

::: {columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   "using **words**"

-   "for exploring and understanding the **meaning** individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem."

-   **open-ended** questions and responses

-   **flexible** report structure
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![For example: Domestic abuse/violence](image/abuse.jpg){fig-align="center"}

![](image/framework-research.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Research Designs: ["types of inquiry"]{style="color:#A51C30"}

::: panel-tabset
## Qualitative

Visible during the 1990s and in the 21st century.

-   **Narrative research** from the humanities ... one or more individuals to provide stories about their lives.

-   **Phenomenology** from philosophy and psychology ... description culminates in the essence of the experiences for several individuals who have all experienced the phenomenon.

-   **Grounded theory** from sociology in which the researcher derives a general, abstract theory of a process, action, or interaction grounded in the view of participants.

-   **Ethnography** from anthropology and sociology in which the research studies the shared patterns of behaviors, languages, and actions of an intact cultural group in a natural setting.

-   **Case study** researcher develops an in-depth analysis of a case ... collect detailed information using a variety of data collection procedures

## Quantitative

During the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century.

-   **Experimental Designs** seeks to determine if a specific treatment influences an outcome.

-   **Survey research** provides a quantitative or numeric description of trends, attitudes, or opinions of a population by studying a **sample** of that **population**.

## Mixed Methods

Began in late 1980s

-   **Convergent mixed methods** collects both forms of data at the same time and integrates the information in the results.

-   **Explanatory sequential** quantitative studies followed by the qualitative study, the qualitative study was conducted to explain further/better the results of quantitative study.

-   **Exploratory sequential** qualitative study was done first then this study's results are used to do the quantitative study.

-   Transformative, embedded, or multi-phase
:::

## Research Methods

"Involve the **forms of** data collection, analysis, and interpretation that researchers propose for their studies"

![](image/framework-research.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Research Methods:

# [ethics]{style="color:#ffffff"} {.big-text background-image="image/ethics.jpg" background-size="coveer"}

<br> <br>

## Ethics & Research[^12]

[^12]: @sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

-   "code of conduct or expected societal norms of behaviour while conducting research."
-   Ethical conduct applies to:
    -   the organization,

    -   the members that sponsor the research,

    -   the researchers who undertake the research, and

    -   the respondents who provide them with the necessary data.

## Ethical Issues in Research[^13]

[^13]: @creswellResearchDesignQualitative2018

::: nonincremental
1.  Prior to conducting the study

2.  Beginning of the study

3.  Collecting data

4.  Analyzing data

5.  Reporting, sharing, and storing data
:::

## Prior to conducting the study

::: panel-tabset
## Issue Type

-   Examine professional association standards.

-   Seek college/university approval on campus through the board.

-   Gain local permission from site and participants.

-   Select a site without a vested interest in outcome of study.

-   Negotiate authorship for publication.

## :thought_balloon: Writing as Thinking

-   Do not edit your proposal at the early-draft stage.

    -   First develop an outline; it could be a sentence or word outline or a **visual map**
    -   Write out a **draft** and then shift and sort ideas, moving entire paragraphs in the manuscript.
    -   Finally, **edit and polish** each sentence.

## :memo: The Habit of Writing

-   Establish the **discipline** of writing in a **regular and continuous** way on your proposal.

-   Make writing a daily activity, regardless of **mood**, regardless of readiness to write.

-   Write while you are **fresh.**

-   Avoid writing in **binges** (excessive).

-   Write in small, regular amounts

-   Schedule writing tasks

-   Time spent writing + page finished + tasks completed

-   Share your writing with **supportive peers.**

## :vomiting_face: Reabability of the Manuscript/Draft

-   Use **consistent terms** in your proposal.

-   Readers need **road signs** to guide them from one major idea to the next.

-   Coherence in writing means that the ideas tie together and **logically flow** from one sentence to another and from one paragraph to another.

## Voice, Tense, and "Fat"

-   Use the **active voice** as much as possible in scholarly writing.

-   Use strong active verbs.

-   Pay close attention to the tense of past studies:

    -   Past simple tense or the present perfect tense for the **literature review and procedures** based on past events,
    -   The past simple tense to **describe results**,
    -   The present tense to **discuss the result**s and to present the **conclusions**.

-   Edit and revise drafts to **trim the fat**.

# [Research<br>Proposal]{style="color:#ffffff"} {background-image="image/proposal.jpg" background-size="contain" background-position="right" background-color="black"}

## Research Proposal[^17]

[^17]: @babbiePracticeSocialResearch2020

-   Most organized research begins with a description of **what is planned** in the project: what questions it will raise and how it will answer them.

-   Often such proposals are created for the purpose of **getting the resources** needed to conduct the research envisioned.

## Research Proposal[^18]

[^18]: @sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

-   Before any research study is undertaken, there should be an **agreement** between the person who authorizes the study and the researcher as to:

    -   the problem to be investigated,

    -   the methodology to be used,

    -   the duration of the study, and

    -   its cost.

## Arguments Presented in a Proposal

1.  What do readers need to better understand your topic?

2.  What do readers need to know about your topic?

3.  What do you propose to study?

4.  What is the setting, and who are the people you will study?

5.  What methods do you plan to use to collect data?

6.  How will you analyze the data?

7.  How will you validate your findings?

8.  What ethical issues will your study present?

9.  What do preliminary results show about the practicability and value of the proposed study?

## Format for a Quantitative Proposal

-   Introduction

-   Statement of the problem (issue, existing literature about problem, deficiencies in literature, relevance of study for audiences)

-   Purpose of the study

-   Research questions or hypotheses

-   Theoretical perspective

-   Review of the literature (theory may be included in this section instead of the introduction)

-   Methods

-   Type of research design (e.g., experimental, survey)

-   Population, sample, and participants

-   Data collection instruments, variables, and materials

-   Data analysis procedures

## Tips: Designing the Sections of a Proposal[^19]

-   Specify the sections early in the design of a proposal. ... develop an outline.

-   Study previous proposal for the same organisation or supervisor.

-   Attend program or course on proposal development

-   Sit down with your adviser or supervisor, and go over his or her preferred format for a proposal.

## Hallmarks of Scientific Research

-   [**Purposiveness:**]{style="color:#00589b"} a definite aim or purpose or goal.

-   [**Rigour:**]{style="color:#00589b"} a good theoretical base and a sound methodological design.

-   [**Testability:**]{style="color:#00589b"} hypotheses should be testable.

-   [**Replicability:**]{style="color:#00589b"} similar findings emerge on the basis of data collected by others employing the same methods.

## Hallmarks of Scientific Research - [Precision and confidence:]{style="color:#00589b"}

-   To design the research in a manner that ensures that our findings are as close to reality as possible.

    -   **Precision:** refers to the closeness of the findings to "reality" based on a sample.
    -   **Confidence:** refers to the probability that our estimations are correct.

## Hallmarks of Scientific Research - [Objectivity:]{style="color:#00589b"}

-   Conclusions should be based upon the facts of the findings derived from actual data,and not on our own subjective or emotional values.

-   The more objective the interpretation of the data, the more scientific the research investigation becomes.

## Hallmarks of Scientific Research - [Generalizability:]{style="color:#00589b"}

-   Refers to the scope (wider range) of applicability of the research findings in one organizational setting to other settings.

-   Not many research findings can be generalized to all other settings.

-   A more elaborate sampling design, which would doubtless increase the generalizability of the results.

## Hallmarks of Scientific Research - [Parsimony:]{style="color:#00589b"}

-   Simplicity in explaining the phenomena or problems that occur.

-   A good understanding of the problem and the important factors that influence it.

1.  Begin by identifying **key words.**

2.  Searching the **databases** like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), Web of Science, EBSCO, ProQuest, and JSTOR or you can also use website like [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/) to download books and papers.

3.  Locate about 50 reports of research in **articles or books** related to research on your topic.

4.  Skim this initial group of articles or chapters, and collect those that are **central to your topic**.

## :sob: [Literature Review Process...]{style="color:#36013F"}

5.  Designing a **literature map** ... a **visual picture of groupings** of the literature on the topic that illustrates how your particular study will add to the existing literature and position your study within the larger body of research.

6.  Begin to **draft summaries** of the most relevant articles. Include precise references to the literature using an appropriate style guide like [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines).

## :sob: [Literature Review Process]{style="color:#36013F"}

7.  After **summarizing** the literature,

-   assemble the literature review, structuring it **thematically** or organizing it by **important concepts**.

-   This summary should also point toward the **methods** ...

-   It is at this point as well that you could advance a **critique of the past** literature and point our **deficiencies** in it and issues in its methods.

## [The Role of Theory]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   Some research is aimed at **building theory** ...

-   other to **test** a theory ...

-   to **describe** what is going on, using an existing framework, instrument, or model.

## [The Use of Theory]{style="color:#0e6251"}[^29] [in Quan Research:]{style="color:#FF6347"}

[^29]: @creswellResearchDesignQualitative2018

-   Researchers often **test hypotheses** stemming from theories.

-   Broader theory **guiding** to the study hypotheses.

## [The Use of Theory]{style="color:#0e6251"} [in Qual Research]{style="color:#FF6347"}

-   It may **generate a theory** as the final outcome of a study and place it at the end of a project

-   Sometimes it comes at the beginning and **provides a lens** that shapes what is looked at and the questions asked

## [The Use of Theory]{style="color:#0e6251"} [in Mixed Methods]{style="color:#FF6347"}

-   Researchers may both **test** theories and **generate** them

-   Contain a theoretical framework within which **both** quantitative and qualitative data are collected

## [Quantitative Theory Use]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   **Causality:** means we would expect variable $X$ to cause variable $Y$.

-   Does drinking one glass of red wine daily ($X$) *cause* you have a reduced risk for a heart attack ($Y$)?

-   Do number of playing hours ($a$) and attendance ($b$) influence the marks in the exam ($z$)?

## [Causality]{style="color:#0e6251"}

$$Red\;Wine \longrightarrow Heart\;attack$$ $$X \longrightarrow Y$$

## [Variables in Quantitative Research]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   **Variable:** "refers to a [characteristic or attribute]{style="color:#FF6347"} of an individual or an organization that can be measured or observed and that [varies]{style="color:#FF6347"} among the people or organization being studied."

-   *Gender, age, socio-economic status; attitudes or behaviors such as racism, social control, political power, leadership* etc..

## [Variables in Quantitative Research]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   **Independent variables:**

    -   Those that [influence, or affect outcomes]{style="color:#FF6347"} in experimental studies.

    -   They are [manipulated]{style="color:#FF6347"} in an experiment and thus independent of all other influences.

## [Variables in Quantitative Research]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   **Dependent variables:**

    -   Those that depend on the independent variables,

    -   They are the [outcomes or results]{style="color:#FF6347"} of the influence of the independent variables

## [Variables in Quantitative Research]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   Independent variable/Predictor variable

-   Dependent variable / Outcome variable

-   Confounding variable

-   Mediating variable

-   Moderating variable

## [Hypothesis (plural is hypotheses)]{style="color:#0e6251"}[^30]

[^30]: @sekaranResearchMethodsBusiness2016

-   "a tentative, yet testable, statement, which **predicts** what you expect to find in your **empirical** data."

-   "logically **conjectured relationships** between two or more variables expressed in the form of testable statements"

## [Hypothesis Development: If-then statements]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   *Young women will more likely to express dissatisfaction with their body weight, when they are more frequently exposed to images of thin models in advertisements.*

-   *If young women are more frequently exposed to images of thin models in advertisements, then they will be more likely to express dissatisfaction with their body weight.*

## [Directional Hypothesis Development:]{style="color:#0e6251"}

"the direction of the relationship between the variables (positive/negative) is indicated"

-   *The greater the stress experienced in the job, the lower the job satisfaction of employees.*

-   *Women are more motivated than men.*

## [Non-directional Hypothesis Development:]{style="color:#0e6251"}

"postulate a relationship or difference, but offer no indication of the direction of these relationships or differences"

-   *There is a relation between arousal-seeking tendency and consumer preferences for complex product designs.*

-   *There is a difference between the work ethic values of American and Asian employees.*

## [Theory in Quantitative Research]{style="color:#0e6251"}

"A set of **interrelated constructs** (variables), definitions, and prepositions that presents a systematic view of phenomena by **specifying relations** among variables, with the purpose of **explaining natural phenomena**" (adapted from Kerlinger 1979)

1.  Investigators **combine** independent, mediating, and dependent variables into questions.

2.  These questions provide information about the **type of relationship** (positive, negative, or unknown) and its magnitude (high or low).

3.  Forming this information into a **predictive statement** (hypothesis)

4.  When researcher **test hypotheses** over and over in different settings and with different populations, a theory emerges, and someone gives it a name.

5.  Theory develops as an **explanation** to advance knowledge in particular fields.

## [Levels of Theory]{style="color:#0e6251"}

-   **Micro-level Theories:** provide explanations limited to small slices of time, space, or number of people; such as Goffman's theory of face work.

-   **Meso-level Theories:** link micro and macro levels; like theories of organizations, social movement, or communities; such as Collin's theory of control in organizations.

-   **Macro-level Theories:** explain larger aggregates, such as social institutions, cultural systems, and whole societies; such as theory of social stratification.

                "Theories are found in the literature, and their inclusion in a literature review is a logical extension or part of the literature.",
                "The theory discussion is a logical extension of hypotheses or research questions because it explains how and why variables are related.",
                "This approach clearly separates the theory from other components of the research process, and it enables a reader to better identify and to understand the theory base for the study."),
  Disadvantage = c("It is difficult for a reader to isloate and speparate theory base from other components of the research process (e.g., with the methods).",
                   "It is difficult for a reader to see the theory in isolation form topics being reviewed in the literature.",
                   "A write may include a theoretical rationale after hypotheses and questions and leave out an extended discussion about the origin and rationale for the use of the theory.",
                   "The theory discussion standss in isolation from other components of the research proceess (e.g., the questions of the methods) and, as such, a reader may not easily connect it with other components of the research process.")

## Quantitative Methods

-   "these designs reflect **post-positivist** philosophical assumptions"

-   "examining the **relationships** between and among variables is central"

## Survey Design

-   "provides a **quantitative description** of trends, attitudes, and opinions of population, or...

-   tests for **associations among variables** of a population,...

-   by studying a **sample** of that population."

## Survey Design Helps

-   **Descriptive** Questions
    -   [*What percentage of students experience ragging in the higher education?*]{style="color:#3D3D3D"}
-   Questions about the **relationships** between variables
    -   [*Is there a positive association between the number of study hours and the marks obtained?*]{style="color:#3D3D3D"}

## Element

"An element in a **single member** of the population"

![](https://learninglink.oup.com/static/5e29bfc369c98b0010b09170/resources/sampling.png){fig-align="center" width="575"}

## Sample

"a **subset** of the population. It comprises **some members** selected from it, some, but not all, elements of the population form the sample"

![](https://learninglink.oup.com/static/5e29bfc369c98b0010b09170/resources/sampling.png){fig-align="center" width="500%"}

## Sample

![](https://learninglink.oup.com/static/5e29bfc369c98b0010b09170/resources/sampling.png){fig-align="center" width="575"}

## Subject

"A subject is a **single member** of the sample, just as an element is a single member of the population"

![](https://learninglink.oup.com/static/5e29bfc369c98b0010b09170/resources/sampling.png){fig-align="center" width="575"}

## Sampling Unit

"The sampling unit is the element or set of elements that is available for selection in some stage of the sampling process."

## Sampling

"The process of selecting the right individuals, objects, or events as **representatives** for the entire population"

![](https://hplusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sampling-and-inference.gif){fig-align="center" width="975"}

## The Sampling Process

1.  Define the **population**.

2.  Determine the **sample frame**.

3.  Determine the **sampling design.**

4.  Determine the appropriate **sample size**.

5.  Execute the **sampling process**.

## The Sampling Process...

1.  Define the **population** ... in terms of elements, geographical boundaries, and time.

2.  Determine the **sample frame** ... a representation of all the elements in the population from which the sample is drawn ... it may not be always be a current, up-to-date document

3.  Determine the **sampling design**.

    -   Non-Probability sampling
    -   Probability sampling

## The Sampling Process

4.  Determining the **sample size**.

-   Indicate the number of people in the sample and the procedures to compute this number.

-   Sample trade off: larger sample more accuracy in the inferences but more sample more time and cost.

## Non-Probability Sampling

-   "Any technique in which samples are selected in some way **not suggested by probability theory**"

    -   Relying on available subjects, such as stopping people at a street corner or some other location

    -   "risky" sampling method for social research

    -   No control over the representativeness of a sample

## Purposive or Judgemental Sampling

**(Non-Probability Sampling)**

![](https://rm-15da4.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Purposive-sampling.jpg)

## Purposive or Judgemental Sampling

**(Non-Probability Sampling)**

-   "the units to be observed are selected on the basis of the **researcher's judgement** about which ones will be the most useful or representative"

-   "situation being studied becomes clearer and **certain types of subjects seem more central** to understanding than others"

## Snowball Sampling

**(Non-Probability Sampling)**

![](image/snow.jpeg)

## Snowball Sampling

**(Non-Probability Sampling)**

-   "each person interviewed may be asked to **suggest additional people** for interviewing"

-   "appropriate when the members of a **special population** are difficult to locate"

-   "often employed in field research"

## Quota Sampling

**(Non-Probability Sampling)**

![](https://images.deepai.org/glossary-terms/1d26bd13f5af4c7f9b475c5bb4bf8812/65-Quota-Sampling.jpg)

## Quota Sampling

**(Non-Probability Sampling)**

-   "units are selected for a sample on the basis of **pre-specified characteristics**, so that the total sample will have the same distribution of characteristics assumed to exist in the population being studied."

## Probability Sampling

-   "When researchers want **precise, statistical descriptions** of large populations"

-   "The general term for samples selected in **accordance with probability theory**, typically involving some **random-selection** mechanism"

## Representativeness

![](https://sixsigmastudyguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ds35-1.png)

## Representativeness[^32]

[^32]: @babbiePracticeSocialResearch2020

-   "that quality of a sample of having the **same distribution of characteristics** as the population from which it was selected"

-   "By implication, description and explanation derived from an analysis of the sample may be **assumed to represent similar** ones in the population."

-   "Representativeness is enhanced by probability sampling and provides for **generalizability** and the use of inferential statistics"

## Probability Sampling Methods:

-   Simple Random Sampling (SRS)

-   Systematic Random Sampling,

-   Cluster Sampling, and

-   Stratified Random Sampling

## Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
